        <p>This is a website created as the basis for getting started with the web. I used the Firefox logo as an image to put on the web.</p>
        <p>The colors that make up the Firefox logo are</p>

        <ul>
            <li>blue</li>
            <li>red</li>
            <li>orange</li>
        </ul>
